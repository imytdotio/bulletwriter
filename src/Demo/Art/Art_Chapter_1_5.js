          So, when should you start a blog?
        </h1>
        <P>
          There are two scenarios where starting with a blog is actu- ally the
          right decision.
        </P>
        <P>
          The first scenario is if you are a business selling some sort of
          product or service, and revenue is the primary out- come you are
          looking to drive.
        </P>
        <P>Not credibility.</P>
        <P>Not exposure.</P>
        <P>Not building an audience.</P>
        <P>Not industry perception or social reach.</P>
        <P>
          Revenue <strong>tied to a specific product or service</strong>.
        </P>
        <P>
          Hubspot, for example, is a company that sells CRM software. Their blog
          isn’t really much of a blog at all. It operates much closer to an
          industry publication for dig- ital marketers, and their strategy is to
          publish so much high-quality content that if you are searching for
          anything marketing related on Google, you’ll end up on their web-
          site, discover their CRM tool, and become a customer. In order to do
          this effectively, Hubspot employs and curates 37Chapter 1 work from
          hundreds upon hundreds of contributing writers, creating a content
          marketing machine.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you are a company with a product or service to sell, and you have
          the means to create a “digital media company” within your niche,
          HubSpot is a terrific use case for having an active blog on your
          website. Your blog should become an industry publication, where the
          purpose of that publica- tion is to tap into search traffic around
          specific keywords and increase the likelihood of a reader becoming a
          cus- tomer looking to buy your product or service.
        </P>
        <P>
          The second scenario for starting a blog is the solopreneur, the
          digital marketer, the fitness coach, the individual who is less
          concerned with sharing his or her own individual insights and
          perspectives, and instead wants to use writ- ing as a marketing
          mechanism for their internet business. These types of websites aren’t
          really about the individ- ual as much as they are the topic (and
          product) they are looking to sell. Sure, some of the best travel or
          nutrition or fitness bloggers end up sharing a good amount about their
          own lives in the process, but their blog content is primarily focused
          on providing informative answers to popular ques- tions directly
          related to their product or service.
        </P>
        <P>
          One of the best examples I’ve ever seen is a website called
          Kindlepreneur. This is an entire website dedicated to educating
          self-published authors on how to optimize and maximize their
          self-publishing efforts. It’s an absolute behemoth of a website,
          insanely informative, and con- structed in a way where if you are the
          target audience, you can’t help but find your way to the site, devour
          the free blog content, type your email into one of the many opt-in
          forms for more detailed information, and even purchase one of the
          products (I did).
        </P>
        <P>
          The important thing I’d like to point out, however, is that when I
          thought to include this example, the writer’s name wasn’t what came to
          mind. What came to mind was Kin- dlepreneur, the name of the site—and
          if you go to the site yourself, you’ll see that’s the way it’s
          presented on the front page. Kindlepreneur with Dave Chesson.
        </P>
        <P>
          In this sense, Dave’s blog has almost nothing to do with sharing and
          scaling his own thoughts, stories, opin- ions, and insights, and is
          more centered around building a brand and “ultimate encyclopedia” of
          knowledge for any- thing related to one singular topic:
          self-publishing.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you are a company with the resources to build and scale your
          website into an industry publication, you should start a blog. And if
          you are a solopreneur who wants to “own” a category or niche by
          creating a direc- tory of knowledge, you should start a blog. But if
          you don’t fit within either of these two categories, then blogging is
          not your best path forward.
        </P>
        <P>
          Now, there is a third scenario where you can be a suc- cessful
          “blogger.” However, it is an outlier scenario, and not one I would
          recommend. Maybe five or ten years ago. But not anymore.
        </P>
        <P>The example that comes to mind here is Mark Manson.</P>
        <P>
          For those who can’t place the name, Mark Manson is the author of the
          bright orange book that took over every bookstore from 2017 to 2020,
          The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck.
        </P>
        <P>
          Most people don’t know that Manson started blogging on his own
          website, www.markmanson.net, more than a decade ago (hence why I
          believe this strategy is outdated, 39Chapter 1 but I digress). Slowly
          but surely, he gained a following for his musings related to personal
          development, and even says overtly on his About page, “Most of what I
          write is written for myself, first and foremost.”
        </P>
        <P>This is the purest form of blogging</P>
        <P>
          When Manson crossed over into the world of Online Writing was the
          moment he started using data to inform decisions that brought him
          outside of his personal website. As the story goes, The Subtle Art Of
          Not Giving A F*ck was actually one of Manson’s most popular blog
          posts, which was then expanded on and turned into a book (the logic
          being: “If millions of people resonate with a blog post on this topic,
          surely they would enjoy a longer version.”). The Subtle Art went on to
          become a #1 New York Times best seller with more than six million
          copies sold.
        </P>
        <P>
          The reason I say Manson’s approach is outdated is because newer,
          better tools have been created in the past ten years that make the
          process of building your name, audience, and credibility as a writer
          exponentially faster.
        </P>
        <P>
          When Manson first started his website and blog, websites like Medium
          and Quora didn’t exist. You couldn’t publish articles yet on LinkedIn.
          Blogger was still one of the best publishing platforms on the internet
          (and to be honest, it wasn’t that good). Facebook and Twitter were
          infants. YouTube was just starting to turn “vloggers” into internet
          celebrities. And the term “influencer” didn’t even exist yet. Every
          benefit that came with having a blog a decade ago can now be achieved
          in 1/100th the amount of time—if you understand how to play the game
          of capturing and keeping people’s attention online.
