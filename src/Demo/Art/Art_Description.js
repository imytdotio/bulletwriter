        What are the secrets to writing online?  Why do some writers accumulate
        hundreds of thousands, even millions of views on their content—and
        others write and write, only to go unnoticed? Nicolas Cole, one of the
        most viral columnists on the internet with more than 100 million views
        on his writing, is pulling back the curtain. After becoming the #1

        writer for Inc Magazine from 2016 to 2018, Cole went on to build a
        multi-million-dollar ghostwriting company publishing thousands of
        articles on the internet for more than 300 different Silicon Valley
        entrepreneurs, C-level executives, New York Times best-selling authors,
        Olympic athletes, Grammy-winning producers, and renowned industry
        leaders
